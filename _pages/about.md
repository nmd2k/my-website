:wave: I'm Dung (Dzung). I graduated with honors degree in Computer Science from [University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam National University](https://uet.vnu.edu.vn/truong-dai-hoc-cong-nghe-15-nam-xay-dung-va-truong-thanh/) (UET). 

<!-- During my uni days at UET AI laboratory, I dove into projects that brought computer vision and machine learning to life – think detecting human motion. I even ventured into the intriguing realm of multilingual datasets and conversational AI, aiming to spread language prowess to Vietnamese. -->

Since 2022, I've been working as a researcher and engineer at [FPT Software AI Center's AI Residency program](https://www.fpt-aicenter.com/ai-residency/), where I received guidance from [Dr. Nghi Bui](https://bdqnghi.github.io/) from Singapore Management University.

In my current role as an AI researcher, I'm all about embedding Machine Learning, Deep Learning into Software systems to solve problems like **code search, code summarization, code generation**, etc. The ultimate goal of my research is to revolutionize the way software is developed, improving its **effectiveness, dependability, and accessibility**. I aim to develop AI-powered tools that can seamlessly **understand, produce, and optimize source code, minimizing human effort and error**.

Therefore, I'm also working on AI-powered solutions for real-world software problems, like [suggeting comments for source code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AIC.docify&ssr=false&fbclid=IwAR1NitAdBfanSTWP_gIqgXQPsb1DcIpXW-f-13drZ5HKnV59V20D-QXOow8) and [extracting code structures for AI models](https://github.com/FSoft-AI4Code/CodeText-parser). Lately, with the wave of Large Language Models, I spent my work on integrating LLMs into coding-assist Chatbots and Unit-test generator for developer.

I’m best reached via [email](mailto:dungnm.workspace@gmail.com). I’m always up for dicussions, collaboration, or opportunities to pursue higher education abroad.
