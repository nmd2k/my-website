:wave: I'm Dũng (Dzung). I graduated with honors degree in Computer Science from [University of Engineering and Technology, Vietnam National University](https://uet.vnu.edu.vn/en) (UET).

Since 2022, I’ve been working as a researcher and engineer at [FPT Software AI Center's AI Residency](https://www.fpt-aicenter.com/ai-residency/) program, under the mentorship of [Dr. Nghi Bui](https://bdqnghi.github.io/) from Singapore Management University.

My passion lies in embedding Deep Learning into software systems to tackle code-related challenges, _(e.g. code search, code repair and code generation)_. With the growing impact of Large Language Models (LLMs), my current focus is on integrating these models into coding-assist tools. My projects include automated unit-test generation for testers, developing an all-in-one chatbot to assist developers, and evaluating LLMs’ ability to comprehend and solve programming problems.

My goal is to transform software development by making it more **efficient** and **accessible**. I aim to build AI-driven agents capable of understanding, generating, and optimizing source code, reducing the need for human intervention and minimizing errors.

I’m best reached via [email](mailto:dungnm.workspace@gmail.com).
