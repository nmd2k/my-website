about_me: "
  In 2025, I am honored to have been awarded the Melbourne Research Scholarship for talented individuals. 
  I am currently pursuing my PhD at the University of Melbourne (ranked 19* worldwide), 
  under the supervision of Dr. Bach Le Dinh Xuan and Dr. Thuan Nguyen.<br><br>
  Previously, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Vietnam National University in 2022, 
  where I was supervised by Dr. Tran Quoc Long, Director of the Institute for Artificial Intelligence.<br><br>

  From 2022 to 2025, I joined the AI Residency Program at the FPT AI Center**, 
  working alongside outstanding young researchers across Vietnam. 
  With invaluable mentorship from Dr. Nghi Bui (Salesforce Senior Scientist; 
  Product Owner & Lab Manager at FPT Software) and Dr. Quang Pham (Research Scientist at A*STAR), 
  I published research papers at leading international conferences, including ICLR, EMNLP, and NAACL.<br><br>

  Beyond academia, I am an active contributor to open-source projects and always 
  welcome opportunities for collaboration. The best way to reach me is via email.<br><br>

research_interests: "
  My research lies at the intersection of <strong>large language models (LLMs), software engineering, and cybersecurity</strong>. I am particularly interested in making AI-powered code generation more <strong>secure, reliable, and trustworthy</strong>. <br><br>

  Specifically, I focus on:<br>
    • <strong>Reinforcement Learning for Secure Code</strong> designing RL-based methods (e.g., PPO, DPO, multi-agent RL) to align LLMs with secure software engineering practices.<br>
    • <strong>Adversarial Robustness</strong> developing fine-tuning and adversarial training strategies to reduce vulnerabilities in LLM-generated code.<br>
    • <strong>Benchmarking & Evaluation</strong> creating new benchmarks to measure threat awareness, vulnerability detection, and resilience of LLMs in real-world scenarios.<br>
    • <strong>Automation in Secure Software Development</strong> building scalable frameworks that integrate security into LLM-powered coding assistants, reducing reliance on human oversight.<br><br>

  Broadly, my goal is to advance <strong>secure and autonomous software engineering</strong>, ensuring that the next generation of AI systems can empower developers without amplifying cybersecurity risks.
