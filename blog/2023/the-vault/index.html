It is the largest corpus containing parallel code-text data. By building upon <strong><a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/the-stack" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Stack</a></strong>, a massive raw code sample collection, The Vault offers a comprehensive and high-quality resource for advancing research in code understanding and generation. The dataset also comes with an accessible toolkit for supporting the community and encouraging customize and improvement.</p> <h1 id="demand-for-large-scale-resource-parallel">Demand for large-scale resource parallel</h1> <p>The urgency for a massive parallel dataset in the domain of AI for code (AI4Code) stems from the increasing need to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) for code generation and understanding. Despite the proliferation of open-source code repositories, we found out that existing code-text pair datasets, like CONCODE, FunCom, and CodeSearchNet, are significantly smaller than raw code datasets (CodeParrot Github, The Stack, The Pile, etc).</p> <p>In our experiment, we believe this size disparity has become a bottleneck for training AI4Code LLMs that rely heavily on fine-tuning pre-trained models using parallel code-text datasets. While models using non-parallel data or raw source code files are growing rapidly, those using code-text pair data (or bimodal) and chunked unimodal data (which only contain a certain level of code snippet) are constrained by data size.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/the-vault/the-vault-1-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/the-vault/the-vault-1-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/the-vault/the-vault-1-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/posts/the-vault/the-vault-1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 1: A comparison table between current available function parallel dataset </div> <p>Furthermore, existing datasets like CoDesc, PyMT5, etc are limited to specific programming languages, underscoring the need for more diverse and larger datasets. Additionally, data quality plays a significant role in enhancing AI model performance. Therefore, the introduction of a large, high-quality dataset that spans multiple programming languages could greatly encourage the advancement of AI4Code LLMs.</p> <h1 id="what-does-the-vault-provide">What does The Vault provide?</h1> <p>CoDesc highlights the challenges faced by many tasks in the domain AI4Code, primarily the difficulty due to the lack of a standard noise removal method besides the lack of large standard datasets suitable for training deep neural models. To address those obstacles, we present The Vault, an extensive parallel dataset of code and docstring/comment. Our aim is to contribute to the community by providing a vast resource for training and evaluating natural language processing models related to code.</p> <p>Additionally, we also openly share our cleaning techniques and pipeline to extract data from raw code files, which involve careful design and analysis to enhance the data quality and optimize the performance in downstream tasks. When we design our cleaning rule, besides the 13 heuristics rule to eliminate un-informative data, we also apply a deep learning approach is utilized to refine the matching score between the parallel elements of The Vault.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/the-vault/the-vault-2-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/the-vault/the-vault-2-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/the-vault/the-vault-2-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/posts/the-vault/the-vault-2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>Our dataset and code are available to the community, and can easily access via Github and HuggingFace.

The input is a piece of code, and the output is a concise summary explaining its functionality.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/the-vault/the-vault-3-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/the-vault/the-vault-3-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/the-vault/the-vault-3-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/posts/the-vault/the-vault-3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>Traditionally, models are trained on parallel datasets containing code and corresponding comments or descriptions. However, these datasets can be noisy and limited, with descriptions that can be ambiguous, incomplete, or even misleading. In The Vault, we carefully design a cleaning method to capture all the informative sections of the docstring/description in order to boost model performance in the summarization task.</p> <h3 id="code-search">Code search</h3> <p>Code search is the task of retrieving relevant code snippets given a natural language query. The input is a query in natural language, and the output is a set of code snippets that satisfy the query. Models for this task are typically trained or fine-tuned using code and associated natural language descriptions from parallel datasets where both will be embedded into a vector space and compare similarities with each other.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/the-vault/the-vault-4-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/the-vault/the-vault-4-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/the-vault/the-vault-4-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/posts/the-vault/the-vault-4.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>However, the effectiveness of a code search system heavily depends on the quality and diversity of its training data. Therefore, a well-curated, large, and diverse parallel dataset can significantly reduce this challenge and boost the model’s understanding of the relationship between code and natural language, resulting in better performance.</p> <h3 id="code-generation">Code generation</h3> <p>Code generation, or text-to-code, involves creating code based on a natural language description. The input is a description of a desired functionality, and the output is the code that performs that function. Models for this task are usually trained or fine-tuned on parallel datasets that contain pairs of natural language descriptions and their corresponding code. However, the existing datasets are often limited in their coverage of programming languages and can contain noisy or low-quality examples. A large, diverse, and high-quality parallel dataset can provide a broader range of examples and contexts, thereby improving the model’s ability to generate syntactically and semantically correct code across various languages and tasks.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/the-vault/the-vault-5-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/the-vault/the-vault-5-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/the-vault/the-vault-5-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/posts/the-vault/the-vault-5.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <h3 id="more-advanced-problems">More advanced problems</h3> <p>When extracting the Vault, our focus extends beyond extracting parallel elements from the source code. We make an effort to extract as much metadata as possible, including function/class information. The metadata obtained from The Vault dataset, such as parameter descriptions and types found in docstrings, can be utilized to generate more detailed and informative code summaries. By leveraging this information, models can provide insights into the purpose, expected inputs, and outputs of the suggested code, enhancing the summarization process.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/the-vault/the-vault-6-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/the-vault/the-vault-6-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/posts/the-vault/the-vault-6-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/posts/the-vault/the-vault-6.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>To extract docstring metadata, we have developed a docstring style parser capable of extracting information from each style.
