## Abstract

> Recent advancements in Code Large Language Models (CodeLLMs) have predominantly focused on open-ended code generation tasks, often neglecting the critical aspect of code understanding and comprehension. To bridge this gap, we present CodeMMLU, a comprehensive multiple-choice question-answer benchmark designed to evaluate the depth of software and code understanding in LLMs. CodeMMLU includes over 10,000 questions sourced from diverse domains, encompassing tasks such as code analysis, defect detection, and software engineering principles across multiple programming languages. Unlike traditional benchmarks, CodeMMLU assesses modelsâ€™ ability to reason about code rather than merely generate it, providing deeper insights into their grasp of complex software concepts and systems. Our extensive evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art models face significant challenges with CodeMMLU, highlighting deficiencies in comprehension beyond code generation. By underscoring the crucial relationship between code understanding and effective generation, CodeMMLU serves as a vital resource for advancing AI-assisted software development, ultimately aiming to create more reliable and capable coding assistants.
